HSF steps:
1. Decide on your environmental variables
2. Decide (hypothesize) whether each is a resource, risk, or condition
  -- Resources and risks can probably be modeled with just a single coefficient
  -- Conditions should probably be modeled with a parabola (x + x^2)
3. Decide on your availability domain.
4. From within your availability domain, sample a large number of available points to combine with your used points. (line 265)
5. Attach your environmental variables to your used and available points. (line 266)
6. Assign large weights (e.g., 5000) to the available points and 1 to the used points. (make a new column; line 268)
7. Use logistic regression (as a fitting trick) to estimate the betas of your HSF. (line 271)
8. Interpret your fitted model
  -- Probably some combination of:
    * Summarize the coefficients (line 275)
    * What-if scenarios (using RSS; lines 325 - 385)
    * RSS figures (or log-RSS figures; lines 392 - 503)
    * Maps (either w(x), RSS, or log-RSS; lines 505 - end)
