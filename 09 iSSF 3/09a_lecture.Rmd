# Topics

What to do, if we 

- have multiple animals
- have different behavioral modes
- have irregular sampling rates
- want to account for non-linear relationships
- want to account for spatial autocorrelation in covariates
- ...‚

# Multiple individuals

## Why should we care?

- Most telemetry studies have data from many animals.
- Often individual behave very different (and we can fully account for these differences in a model).
- We are often interested in population-level effects (i.e., how would an average animal behave).


---- 

## How-to account for individual differences

1. *Ignore individuals and fit data to all animals.*
2. Fit an individual model for each individual. 
3. Use a mixed-model strategy. 

-----

## 2. Fit an individual model for each individual. 

- A somewhat naive approach could be, to fit to each individual animal the model of interests (e.g., a SSF or an iSSF).

- In a next step we can then "do statistics" with the coefficients of the individual model. For example, we could 
  - calculate the mean and confidence intervals to obtain population level effects, or 
  - use a linear models to relate coefficient values to other explanatory covariates. 


- A difficulty is if we have extreme observations or some levels of a categorical covariate is not observed for all animals. 

----

There are different programming strategies, how one could approach such a situation: 

a. *Write customized code for each individual.*
b. Use some kind of looping structure (for example a `for`-loop). 
c. Use a nest-unnest approach, as we have seen previously (for example with the `purrr` package). 

----------

An example of this approach was used in Signer et al. 2019

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Source Signer et al. 2019"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/signer2019.jpg")
```

----

## 3. Use a mixed-model strategy. 


- For HSF this is *relatively* straight forward. We can make use of well established tools that were developed for GLMMs.

- For iSSFs this is slightly more challenging. We have to use a likelihood equivalent reformulation of the iSSF as a poisson regression with random effects for each strata with a fixed large variance. 

-----

## Random effects for HSFs

	
- Random effects were proposed for HSFs over 15 years ago\footnotemark[2]

\end{figure}
	
\pause

- Majority of studies between 2016 and 2020 (80 %) only include random intercept and no random slope(s).
	
\footnotetext[2]{Gillies et al. "Application of random effects to the study of resource selection by animals." Journal of Animal Ecology 75.4 (2006): 887-898.}

------

Muff et al. 2020 had another look at this issue and extended this also to iSSF.
	
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img/muff.png"))
```

## A case study for HSF/RSF

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::read_chunk(here::here("09 iSSF 3/additional_scripts/goats.R"))
```

- Data on habitat selection of Mountain Goats\footnotemark[3]
-	Generalized linear model with binomial response (GLM), random intercept (GLMM 1), and random intercept and slopes (GLMM 2).



\footnotetext[3]{Lele \& Keim, (2006) Weighted distributions and estimation of resource selection probability functions. Ecology 87, 3021–3028.}

----

Let us fit three models to tracking data from wild goats: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
<<goat.models>>
```



----

Comparing the model coefficients: 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img/rsf_re.png"))
```

\pause

For RSF use random intercept **and** random slope(s)\footnotemark[4].

## Accounting for animal-specific variation (SSF)


\only<1->{ Conditional logistic regression with random effects is more difficult

\begin{equation*} 
\text{P}(y_{ntj}=1 \,|\, \pmb{x}_{nt\cdot}) = \pi_{ntj} = 
\frac{\exp( \pmb\beta^\top \pmb{x}_{ntj})}
{\sum_{j = 1}^J \exp( \pmb\beta^\top \pmb{x}_{nti})}  
\end{equation*}}
	
- $n = 1, \dots, N$ individuals, with realized steps, 
- time points $t = 1, \dots, T_n$, with 
- $j = 1, \dots, J_{n,t}$ location that were either used or available. 

-----

- The conditional logistic regression is a special case of the multinomial model.
- The multinomial model is likelihood-equivalent to the Poisson model.
- Thus we can rewrite the conditional logistic regression as a Poisson regression.

---- 

## SSF as poisson model

Reformulation as Poisson model\footnotemark[5] \footnotemark[6]

$$
\text{E}(y_{nti}) = \mu_{nti} = \exp(\alpha_{nt} + \pmb\beta^\top \pmb{x}_{nti} + \pmb{u}^\top \pmb{z}_{nti}) \ ,\quad y_{nti} \sim \text{Po}(\mu_{nti})
$$

- $\alpha_{nt} \sim N(0, \sigma_\alpha^2)$ are the stratum specific intercepts with $\sigma_{\alpha}^2$ being fixed at a very large value.
- $\pmb\beta^\top \pmb{x}_{nti}$  are the selection coefficients and the design matrix, respectively.
- $\pmb{u}^\top \pmb{z}_{nti}$ specify the random effect structure.

## Simulation study from Muff et al. 2020
	
- Simulation of movement for 20 animals with animal-specific selection coefficients.
- For RSFs sample random points within the availability domain
- For SSFs sample random steps from each location

## Software to fit these models

- HSF/RSF:
    - Any standard software package that can fit GLMMs is suitable. 
- iSSF:
    - Frequentist: In R the package `glmmTMB` can be use, because it allows to fix the variance of random effects. 
    - Muff et al. 2020 primarily used a Bayesian approach (INLA), as it straightforward to fix the variance. 

----

## An example from Roshier et al. 2021

- This work I did together with David Roshier from Australian Wildlife Conservancy. 
- I was only involved in the statistical modeling. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/roshier21.png")
```

---

## Data

- Telemetry data for 22 individual foxes at 20 min sampling rate
- Location of water sources (in blue)

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/relocs.png")

```

---

## Analysis

1. Revisitation rates with the `recurse` package^[Bracis, C., Bildstein, K. L., & Mueller, T. (2018). Revisitation analysis uncovers spatio‐temporal patterns in animal movement data. Ecography, 41(11), 1801-1811.]
2. aKDE home ranges
3. integrated step selection analysis

----

## Questions: iSSA

- Do foxes select for pixels closer to water sources? 
- Does the selection depends on whether or not foxes are inside their home range?
- Do foxes move faster/slower when inside/outside their home range?

-----

## Habitat selection

Habitat selection of foxes inside (a) and outside (b) of their home range.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/fig_selection.png")
```


----

Expected displacement (i.e., how far do we expect a 'typical' fox to travel within a 20 minutes). 


```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/fig_speed.png")
```



# Different behavioral modes

We often want to account for different behavioral modes in habitat selection and movement:

\includegraphics<2>[height=0.5\textheight]{../img/suraci2019.png}
\includegraphics<3>[height=0.5\textheight]{../img/picardi2021.png}
\end{figure}

## An integrated approach

\includegraphics<2>[height=0.5\textheight]{../img/klappstein.png}
\includegraphics<3>[height=0.5\textheight]{../img/pohle1.png}
\end{figure}

---

The idea is to simultaneously fit a Markov-switching variant of the conditional logistic regression:

\includegraphics[height=0.4\textheight]{../img/pohle2.png}

A simulation study was done by Pohle et al. 2023

\includegraphics<1>[height=0.7\textheight]{../img/pohle3.png}
\end{figure}



# Irregular sampling rates

In a recent preprint Hofmann et al. compared 4 approaches:

\includegraphics[height=0.6\textheight]{img/hofmann2023.png}
\end{figure}

-----

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[height=0.3\textheight]{img/hofmann2023.png}
\end{figure}

1. Imputation using the `crawl` package.
2. Naive: Following Munden et al. 2021
3. Dynamic+Model: Sample random steps from different tentative distributions. 
4. Multistep: Using multiples of initial step length

----

**Forgiveness:** The maximum step-duration, measured in multiples of the regular step-duration, a modeler is willing to include in the step-selection analysis.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[height=0.6\textheight]{../img/hofmann1.png}
\end{figure}

----

They then did a simulation study and compared the four approaches:
