Let's apply what we've learned about model validation. Refer to the lecture slides (<a href="10a_lecture.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10a_lecture.html</a>) and the walkthrough code (`10b_walkthrough.R`) as a refresher.

Pick a model you fit in a previous exercise, such as an HSF from exercise 5 or an iSSF from exercises 6-8.

## Instructions

1. Start with the script from the previous exercise of your choice.

2. Separate your data into training and testing data.

3. Fit two models to your training data. 

  * The first model can be the one you already fit in the previous exercise.
  * Leave out a variable you think should be important from the second model.
  
4. Create UHC plots for both models. Can you see where the UHC plots are telling you that your model is misspecified?
