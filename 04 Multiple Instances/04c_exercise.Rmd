Let's apply what we've learned about exploratory data analysis. Refer to the lecture slides (`04a_lecture.pdf`) and the walkthrough code (`04b_walkthrough.R`) as a refresher.

We encourage you to use your own data for this exercise. We will be available while you are working to answer any questions.

If you don't have your own data, you can use example data set of collard elephants, that was published by Wall et al. 2014 [here](https://www.datarepository.movebank.org/handle/10255/move.372). We already downloaded the data and stored in `data/elephants.csv`. 


## Instructions

1. Read the data set `data/elephants.csv` (note file paths always start globally). Create a track using, make sure that you set the CRS to 4326. Ensure that the timezone is "GMT". 

2. Transform the track to a projected UTM CRS. You can use EPSG 32630 (https://epsg.io/32630) and filter only for one individual and year.

3. Our working hypothesis is that home-range size is a function of the mean weekly temperature^[If you use your own data, you may want to test for a different covariate]. To test this calculate weekly^[The function `week()` from the `lubridate` package might be useful.] home-range sizes^[Choose a home-range estimator that you like.] and compare the home-range size numerically or graphically to the mean weekly temperature. What do you conclude?
