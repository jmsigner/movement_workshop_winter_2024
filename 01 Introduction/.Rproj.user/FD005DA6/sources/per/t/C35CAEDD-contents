# Welcome!

- Welcome to this online course on animal movement. 
- We are Brain and Johannes.
- Who are you?

# Outline of the course

### Day 1:
- Introduction and exploratory data analysis for movement data (J)
- Quantifying space use of animals with home ranges (B)

### Day 2:
- Continuous time movement models (B)
- Identifying different behavioral states in movement data (J)

### Day 3:
- Introduction to habitat selection (B)
- Integrated step selection functions 1 (J)

----

### Day 4:
- Integrated step selection functions 2 (B)
- Strategies to model multiple animals (J) 

### Day 5:
- Validation of models for habitat selection (B)
- Simulations from fitted iSSF (J)

## Some logistics

- The course is scheduled from Monday (24th of Jan) to Friday (28th of Jan) from 2pm to 8pm Berlin time (that is UTC+2). 

- We split these 6h block into two chunks: 
  - 2pm - 4:45pm and 5:15pm to 8pm
  - Each chunk will consists of 
    - a short lecture
    - an R walkthrough
    - an exercise
    - discussion of the exercise
    
- Lectures will be held via zoom.
- During the whole workshop we have a slack channel where you ask questions (we will monitor it during the course).

# Analysis of movement data in R; Why R? The  `amt` package.

# Some conventions in R

- `%>%` or `|>`: Pipes the output of one function to a next function. We will discuss this further later on. 
- `::` to access a name space form a package. 
- use of \`a\`. 
- `.` means this directory
- `..` refers to the parent directory

----

- We often use `here::here("path to a file")`, when reading in a file. 
- The first `here` calls the function `here()` from the package `here`. 
- The function `here()` dynamically creates the absolute path to the project root. 

```{r}
here::here()
```

This means, that we save all our data in the root directory data (even though my scripts are in different sub directories). 

----

### Brackets (`(`, `[`, `{`)

- round brackets or parentheses (`(`) usually indicate functions or are used in arithmetic calculations. 

```{r}
sqrt(3)
```

or 

```{r}
2 * (3 + 1)
```

---

- square brackets (`[`, `[[`) are used to subset data structures. 

```{r}
letters[1:3]
```

or 

```{r}
head(iris[["Species"]])
```


-----

- curly brackets or braces (`{`) are used to form code blocks (e.g., inside a function or control structure). 


```{r, eval = FALSE}
for (i in 1:10) {
  i^2
} 

```

# Recommended setup


# Tracks and bursts: the basic building block

# CRS a very brief review

# Sampling rates, and resampling

# Detecting outliers

# Movement characteristics (sl_, ta_)

# Time of the day

# Dealing with multiple animals
